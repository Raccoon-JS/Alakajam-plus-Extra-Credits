CONNECT THE WOUNDS is a game made as an entry for both EXTRA CREDITS GAME JAM 4 and 6th ALAKAJAM!.

The theme of ECGJ4 is \"CONNECT\", inspired from a statement made by Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima. The duration for the jam is 100 hours.

The challenges of the game jam are:
- Extra Monochromatic (Use only 2 color palette.)
- Extra Kuleshov Effect (Follow the principles of the Kuleshov Effect to your advantage).
- Extra Open (Make Everything Open Source).
- Extra Remix (Remix feature/asset from your previous projects).
- \"Extra\"-Vert (Make a game that can be played with other people, in person).

The theme of 6th Alakajam! is \"DUEL\". The duration is 48 hours for competitors and 72 for non-competitors.
The coding and the design are all done by myself.
Except the music. The menu theme (Slow Jazz) was done by Alex McCulloch - which is Public Domain, and the gamplay music (In the City) was done by Joshua McLean under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.. And I actually licensed a copyrighted music - which will be available after the game jam.
