6th Alakajam!:
Theme - DUEL

Possible genres and ideas:
- "Running" game where the haunted truck is chasing after the man (inspired by the Spielberg movie DUEL)
- Visual Novel
-- changing images
--- create narrative through Kuleshov effect
-- Hyperlink Story (https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperlinkStory)
--- That's too ambitious
- Two games connecting to one and other
-- one is a simple platformer and the other is top-down shooter
- Choose your adventure game
-- But you need to find the correct path
--- This would depends on the Alakajam theme
--- Kuleshov effect

Chosen genre and idea:
- Visual Novel + Choose Your Adventure Story + Dragon's Lair <--- My decision

--- You already picked the first one.
--- Now you have to pick the other one
---- #C1E3D6 & #419482
---- #E3C5C1 & #A26D66 for the left story, and #C1E3D6 & #419482 for the right story
--- #C1DEE2 & #417D95 for the menu and splash screen 
-- Story:
--- Hyperlink Story (https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperlinkStory)
